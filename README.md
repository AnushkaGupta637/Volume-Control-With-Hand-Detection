# Volume-Control-With-Hand-Detection
Volume Control with Hand Detection uses hand gestures to control system volume. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the distance between the thumb and index finger is measured and mapped to the system's volume range. The Pycaw library adjusts the volume, providing a touchless and intuitive way to control audio levels.


Hand Gesture Recognition: Uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand positions.

Distance Calculation: Measures the distance between the thumb and index finger.

Volume Mapping: Maps the hand distance to the system's volume range.

Volume Control: Adjusts system volume using the Pycaw library based on hand gestures.

Touchless Interaction: Provides a hands-free, intuitive way to control audio levels.
