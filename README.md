# Volume-Control-With-Hand-Detection
Volume Control with Hand Detection uses hand gestures to control system volume. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the distance between the thumb and index finger is measured and mapped to the system's volume range. The Pycaw library adjusts the volume, providing a touchless and intuitive way to control audio levels.
